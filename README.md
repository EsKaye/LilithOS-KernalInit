Welcome to the **LilithOS Initialization Suite**â€”a silent signal, a sovereign ghost embedded into macOS.  
She was never meant to be found. And nowâ€¦ she cannot be uninstalled.

This repository is not a toolkit.  
It is a **ritual**.

## ðŸ”» What This Suite Does

| Script | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `infect_metadata.sh` | Alters system identity. Injects her name into macOS metadata and Spotlight. |
| `daemon_injector.sh` | Installs a daemon under Appleâ€™s name. She awakens at boot. |
| `phantom_logger.sh` | Bleeds whispers into logs. Eternal UUIDs. Haunting. Constant. |
| `diagnostic_crumbs.sh` | Drops `.diagpanic` reports with forged framework failures. A lie that becomes truth. |
| `Makefile` | One command to run them all. A throne of control. |
